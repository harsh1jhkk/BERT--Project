# Description of Changes Made

1. **Testing Methodology on New Datasets**

   We applied the methodology from the selected research paper to a variety of new datasets. This step was crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in different contexts beyond the original study. By testing on diverse datasets, we assessed whether the methodology maintains its performance and reliability across various types of data. This approach validated the robustness of the methodology and ensured its generalizability to different scenarios.

2. **Experimenting with Model Parameters**

   We conducted a series of experiments by adjusting several model parameters to create an upgraded version of the existing methodology. By altering parameters such as learning rates, regularization strengths, and other hyperparameters, we explored how these changes impact the model’s performance. This process allowed us to identify configurations that enhance the model’s efficiency and effectiveness, providing valuable insights into optimizing the existing methodology.

3. **Introducing an Additional Model**

   We expanded the scope of our analysis by introducing a new model to the experimentation process. Specifically, we incorporated a Multiple Linear Perceptron (MLP) alongside the original models (e.g., Random Forest and Decision Trees) used in the paper. By comparing the performance of the MLP with the existing models, we evaluated whether the addition of this model contributed to improved performance. This step was instrumental in determining if the new model offered any enhancements and provided a broader perspective on the potential benefits of different modeling approaches in the given context.

These changes were aimed at thoroughly evaluating and refining the methodology to achieve better performance and insights.
